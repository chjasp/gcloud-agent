# gcloud Command Generator — Overview

## What you get

- **Determinism:** The script only suggests command paths and flags that exist in your installed SDK.
- **Placeholders:** It renders `<SERVICE>`, `<REGION>`, `<PROJECT_ID>`, etc., instead of guessing values.
- **Validation:** `--validate` re-checks that every suggested flag is accepted by the command’s own `--help`.
- **Speed:** First run builds a small index (prioritizes common surfaces like Cloud Run, Compute, Projects, IAM, Pub/Sub, Storage, Secrets, Artifacts, Builds) and caches it. Later runs are instant.
- **Extensibility:** You can expand `RESOURCE_SYNONYMS` and `VERB_SYNONYMS` to match how your users phrase things.

## Quick demo prompts

### Cloud Run service config

**Prompt:** show Cloud Run service configuration

**Likely output:**

```bash
gcloud run services describe <SERVICE> --region=<REGION> --project=<PROJECT_ID> --format=json
```

*(This aligns with the product docs for `gcloud run services describe`.)*

---

### List VMs in a zone

**Prompt:** list VM instances in `europe-west1-b`

**Output** (you’ll see `--zone` because the command supports it):

```bash
gcloud compute instances list --zone=<ZONE> --project=<PROJECT_ID> --format=json
```

*(Common Compute CLI references illustrate this surface.)*

## Notes and references

- The CLI trees and meta commands are how we avoid hallucinations; they are part of the Cloud SDK and power completion/help. See `gcloud topic cli‑trees` and meta commands listings; if needed you can update the trees with `gcloud meta cli-trees update`.
- The Cloud SDK root can be discovered via `gcloud info --format='value(installation.sdk_root)'`. The SDK commonly ships an on-disk CLI tree at `…/data/cli/gcloud.json`.
- The overall `gcloud` shape (component → entity → operation) is documented in the official cheat sheet.

## Integrating with your agent

- Keep **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for root-cause analysis and explanations.
- Pipe any natural-language request through **this script** to get a trustworthy command.
- Optionally feed the returned command back into your toolchain to execute via `subprocess` and parse the `--format=json` output.
- If you want, I can also provide a tiny REST wrapper (FastAPI/Flask) around this so your agent can call `POST /generate` with a prompt and get back `{ command, variants, explanation }`.
